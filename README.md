# SafeLink
<br/>

## ðŸ›‘ THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED

<br/>

SafeLink is a website that'll let people create their own custom short URLs(SafeLinks) that they can share with other people.

When someone shares a SafeLink, before redirecting the person to the website, the SafeLink allows them to view the URL it redirects to and they can manually press the button to open the link.

It might seem counterintuitive at first to add this step, but SafeLink is designed to act a middleground between easily redirecting people to your desired resource all while giving them the power to know where they're being directed.

In the future, there are plans to add more information to the SafeLink page, including website ratings, a screenshot preview, and more.
